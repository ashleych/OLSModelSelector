Description: Automates the OLS Regression. The code generates all combinations 
    of linear regression models. It runs diagnostic tests like tests for
    Autocorrelation, sign  of coefficients (to check for intuitiveness),
    Stationarity tests amongst others. The Main output is a consolidates 
    Results table which is made available in the global environment. This table
    contains the results of all the tests. The user may continue to explore in 
    detail individual models by selecting the model of his choice. Relevant 
    charts are also automatedly produced. It also produces a summary report of 
    the model of his choice. This package however does not assist in variable 
    selection. While glmulti already provides best subset of models, using 
    R-squared and AIC amongst others,it currently it doesnt allow for rank 
    filtering models on the basis of stationarity tests for instance. 
    Also, this package doesnt have any additional dependencies like Rjava
